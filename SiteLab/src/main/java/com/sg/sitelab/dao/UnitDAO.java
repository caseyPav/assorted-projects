/**
 *Develop a simple program which asks the user to first pick a conversion type (temperature,
currency, volume, mass, or some other unit type) and then asks the user for the source unit of
measure (to convert from) and which unit of measure to convert it to. Lastly, ask the user to
enter in a value which the program will convert to the target unit. For instance: the user specifies
temperature and then specifies Celsius to Kelvins. They then enter in a value for Celsius and
the program converts it to Kelvins and prints the result.
Conversion types and units of measure must be in drop down select controls.
